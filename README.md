# Offline-Writer-Identification-System

The pipeline of this project consists of three main modules: preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection and training
This pipeline is similar to any machine learning project pipeline except for the data gathering phase since we used the IAM dataset for training.
As for the testing dataset, we have participated as volunteers in the collection of this data but havenâ€™t been directly concerned with its formation and gathering
